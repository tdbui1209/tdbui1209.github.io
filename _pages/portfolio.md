In this project, I am going to clean a dataset about real estate sales in Hanoi, Vietnam. I will then perform some feature engineering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Finally, I will create a model to predict the price of each home.

[Global Wheat Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-wheat-detection) was a challenge on Kaggle that was held in 2020. Challengers had to detect wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants.

> YOLOv8 is the latest version of YOLO by Ultralytics. As a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, YOLOv8 builds on the success of previous versions, introducing new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency. YOLOv8 supports a full range of vision AI tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, tracking, and classification. This versatility allows users to leverage YOLOv8's capabilities across diverse applications and domains.

In this project, I used YOLOv8_n with an image size of 320x320 as a baseline and applied few augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy.

### Classify handwritten characters in ancient Japanese manuscripts (Kuzushiji-MNIST)

As a beginner japanese learner, so I want to combine japanese and machine learning. I am very excited went i saw this dataset.

Kuzushiji MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format. Since MNIST restricts us to 10 classes, they chose one character to represent each of the 10 rows of Hiragana when creating Kuzushiji-MNIST.

Hiragana „Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™ is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana „Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä as well as kanji Êº¢Â≠ó.

This project is my baseline for further improvements. I hope you enjoy it!

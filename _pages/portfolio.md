In this project, I am going to clean a dataset about real estate sales in Hanoi, Vietnam. I will then perform some feature engineering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Finally, I will create a model to predict the price of each home.

Global Wheat Detection was a challenge on Kaggle that was held in 2020. Challengers had to detect wheat heads from outdoor images of wheat plants.

> YOLOv8 is the latest version of YOLO by Ultralytics. As a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, YOLOv8 builds on the success of previous versions, introducing new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency. YOLOv8 supports a full range of vision AI tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, tracking, and classification. This versatility allows users to leverage YOLOv8's capabilities across diverse applications and domains.

In this project, I used YOLOv8_n with an image size of 320x320 as a baseline and applied few augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy.
